**Theme**: Some letters are never meant to be lost.

---

## SCENE 1: THE SACRED LETTER (3 Panels)

### Panel 1 — The Discovery
**[Close-up]** Stan's hands holding a YELLOWED ENVELOPE — postmarked 1945. Elegant cursive handwriting. A love letter. It fell out of a sorting tray that hasn't been opened since the building was consecrated. The paper seems to glow faintly. Stan's expression: reverence.

> **STAN**: "This has been in the system for eighty years."
>
> **HEATHER**: "Can't we just... deliver it?"
>
> **STAN**: "The address doesn't exist anymore. But the letter still WANTS to be delivered."

### Panel 2 — The Letter is Taken
**[Action shot]** A GUST OF WIND rips through the sorting floor — impossible, there are no windows. The letter is SNATCHED from Stan's hands and pulled downward through a floor vent. The vent leads to THE BASEMENT. Stan lunges, misses. The letter disappears into darkness.

> **SFX**: FWOOOSH
>
> **STAN**: "No. No no no—"
>
> **HEATHER**: "What's in the basement?"
>
> **STAN**: "The Dead Letter Office."

### Panel 3 — The Basement Door
**[Wide low-angle shot]** A heavy steel door marked "DLO — AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY — EST. 1775". The door has CHAINS on it, but they're rusted through. Frost on the handle. Stan, Heather, and Chuck (who invited himself) stand before it. Chuck holds a flashlight that's already flickering.

> **CHUCK**: "I'm sure it's fine. The safety manual says—"
>
> **STAN**: "The safety manual doesn't cover this floor."

## SCENE 2: THE DESCENT (3 Panels)

### Panel 4 — The Staircase
**[Vertical panel]** A spiral staircase descending into darkness. The walls are lined with UNDELIVERED MAIL — millions of letters, packages, postcards — all stuck to the walls like wallpaper. Some of the envelopes MOVE, breathing. The deeper they go, the older the mail gets. Revolutionary War letters. Civil War dispatches. The air is thick with paper dust.

> **HEATHER**: "How deep does this go?"
>
> **STAN**: "As deep as the postal service."
>
> **CHUCK**: "So... to hell?"

### Panel 5 — Paper Golems Spotted
**[Wide shot]** The Dead Letter Office — a VAST underground chamber filled with mountains of dead mail. And moving among the mountains: PAPER GOLEMS. Massive humanoid shapes made entirely of compacted, undelivered mail. They lumber slowly, sorting letters into piles using their massive hands. They're not aggressive — they're ARCHIVISTS, endlessly organizing mail that will never be delivered.

> **HEATHER**: "They're... sorting?"
>
> **STAN**: "They never stopped."

### Panel 6 — The Golem Notices
**[Medium shot]** One Paper Golem turns toward the intruders. Its face is made of hundreds of STAMPS — postage stamps forming eyes, a mouth. It sees Stan's uniform and pauses. Recognition. Then it sees HE'S EMPTY-HANDED — no mail to deliver. It considers this a VIOLATION. It rises to full height.

> **GOLEM**: *(sound of rustling paper)* "RETURN... TO... SENDER..."

## SCENE 3: THE CHASE (3 Panels)

### Panel 7 — Running Through the Archives
**[Dynamic action panel]** The team RUNNING through canyons of dead mail as a Paper Golem lumbers after them. Chuck trips and falls into a pile of mail — letters stick to him like he's magnetized. Heather pulls him free. Stan is scanning the piles, searching for the glowing letter.

> **SFX**: THOOM THOOM THOOM
>
> **CHUCK**: "IT'S ON ME! THE MAIL IS ON ME!"
>
> **STAN**: "STOP SCREAMING AND LOOK FOR THE GLOW!"

### Panel 8 — Heather Finds It
**[Close-up]** Heather spots the 1945 love letter — it's being carried by a SMALLER golem, almost child-sized, made of love letters. This golem is GENTLE, cradling the letter like a baby. It looks up at Heather with stamp-eyes that somehow convey sadness.

> **HEATHER**: "Stan... I found it. But..."
>
> **SMALL GOLEM**: *(whisper of paper)* "Mine..."

### Panel 9 — The Trade
**[Emotional shot]** Heather kneels down to the small golem's level. She reaches into her satchel and pulls out a LETTER SHE WROTE TO HERSELF when she got the job — a reminder of why she joined. She offers the trade. Her letter for the sacred one. The golem considers.

> **HEATHER**: "I know what it's like to hold onto something. Here. Hold onto this instead."

## SCENE 4: THE GHOST (2 Panels)

### Panel 10 — Benjamin Franklin
**[Full dramatic shot]** As Heather takes the sacred letter, the basement SHIFTS. The paper walls part and reveal a FIGURE — translucent, wigged, wearing colonial-era postal rider gear. THE GHOST OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, first Postmaster General. He looks at the team with an expression of bemused approval. The golem bows.

> **FRANKLIN**: "Eighty years. You took your time."
>
> **STAN**: "The union says we go at our own pace."

### Panel 11 — The Blessing
**[Medium shot]** Franklin extends his hand — he's holding an ARROW KEY. But this one is different — it's GOLD, older, inscribed with "NEC TEMERE NEC TIMIDE" (Neither Rashly Nor Timidly). He gives it to Stan. The key pulses with power.

> **FRANKLIN**: "Every door in the service. Every lock. Every barrier. This key was mine. Now it's yours."
>
> **FRANKLIN**: "Now get out of my basement."

## SCENE 5: THE DELIVERY (2 Panels)

### Panel 12 — Back to the Surface
**[Wide shot]** The team emerging from the basement door, blinking in the fluorescent light. The door SEALS behind them — chains re-forming, new and strong. Chuck has paper stuck to his entire body. Heather holds the sacred letter. Stan holds the Golden Arrow Key. Barb is waiting for them with coffee.

> **BARB**: "You look like hell."
>
> **CHUCK**: "Is... is that paper? Am I paper now?"

### Panel 13 — The Final Delivery
**[Final panel — quiet, emotional]** Stan at a GRAVESTONE. The addressee from 1945. He places the letter against the stone. The wind STOPS. For one moment, the letter glows and then fades to normal paper. Delivered. Somewhere, somehow, it was received.

> **STAN**: "Neither rain, nor snow, nor eighty years of bureaucratic neglect."
>
> **[END - EPISODE 5]**
