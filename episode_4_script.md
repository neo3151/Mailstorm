**Theme**: Silence is survival. Sound is death.

---

## SCENE 1: THE SUMMONS (3 Panels)

### Panel 1 — The Blue Ink
**[Wide shot]** The sorting floor. Chuck stands frozen, holding a form — his face drained of color. A single DROP OF BLUE INK is visible on the signature line. Everyone around him has stopped moving. Stan looks up from his tray, sensing the disturbance.

> **CHUCK**: "I... I used blue ink."
>
> **STAN**: "Chuck. Tell me you didn't file that."

### Panel 2 — The Fax Machine Screams
**[Close-up]** The ancient fax machine in the corner SCREAMS to life — paper spewing out like a possessed tongue. The paper is RED. Official seal of THE BOARD visible. Temperature in the room drops — breath is visible. Fluorescent lights flicker.

> **SFX**: BRRRRRRZZZZT
>
> **FAX**: "AUDIT NOTICE — FORM 1017-B — IRREGULARITY DETECTED — INSPECTOR DISPATCHED"

### Panel 3 — Chuck's Demotion/Promotion
**[Medium shot]** Chuck reading the fax with trembling hands. Behind him, a SHADOW is already forming in the doorway — something tall, thin, wearing a suit that's too perfect. The Audit Demon hasn't fully materialized yet, just its silhouette. The other carriers are backing away.

> **CHUCK**: "Level... Eight."
>
> **BARB** (off-panel): "Everyone shut up. NOW."

## SCENE 2: THE QUIET PROTOCOL (3 Panels)

### Panel 4 — Barb Takes Command
**[Dynamic shot]** BARB — Union Rep, built like a tank, gray buzz cut — slams her hand on the break room table. She's pulling out a LAMINATED CARD from her fanny pack labeled "EMERGENCY PROTOCOL 7: THE QUIET". Everyone gathers close. She speaks in a harsh whisper.

> **BARB** (whispering): "Audit Demon. Sound-hunter. It tracks noise. EVERY noise. Breathing is fine. Talking is NOT."
>
> **HEATHER** (whispering): "What happens if—"
>
> **BARB**: "It finds the discrepancy. Then it finds YOU."

### Panel 5 — The Office Goes Silent
**[Wide panoramic]** The entire office in ABSOLUTE SILENCE. Everyone frozen at their stations. Mail is being sorted BY HAND with exaggerated care. No machines running. No scanners beeping. Chuck has duct tape over his mouth (self-applied). Someone has unplugged the microwave. A carrier is holding a sneeze with visible agony. The clock on the wall ticks — each tick drawn with impact lines.

> **SFX**: *tick... tick... tick...*

### Panel 6 — Stan's Tray Problem
**[Close-up]** Stan staring at his Phantom Tray — it's REFILLING. Letters materializing with soft rustling sounds. Each new letter makes the faintest *fwip*. Stan's eye twitches. He slowly, carefully reaches for a rubber band to muffle the tray. Sweat on his brow.

> **STAN** (internal): *The tray doesn't know the rules.*

## SCENE 3: THE DEMON WALKS (3 Panels)

### Panel 7 — It Arrives
**[Full page spread]** THE AUDIT DEMON materializes. It's 8 feet tall, impossibly thin, wearing a pinstripe suit with no wrinkles. Its face is a BLANK OVAL with tiny reading glasses perched where its nose should be. It carries a CLIPBOARD that's chained to its wrist. Its footsteps make no sound — but where it walks, the floor tiles CRACK in perfect grid patterns.

> **SFX**: (silence)

### Panel 8 — The Inspection
**[Medium shot]** The Audit Demon gliding between desks, running one long finger across surfaces, checking for dust, checking forms. It pauses at Chuck's desk. Its blank face TILTS. The clipboard WRITES ITSELF — pen moving on its own. Chuck is sweating through his shirt, duct tape still on mouth. The demon picks up the blue-ink form.

> **CLIPBOARD**: *scratch scratch scratch*

### Panel 9 — Heather's Phone
**[Close-up on horror]** Heather's PHONE starts buzzing in her pocket. Notification. Everyone's eyes go wide. The Audit Demon's blank face slowly rotates toward the sound. Heather's hand is in her pocket, desperately trying to silence it. Stan is reaching toward her — freeze gesture.

> **SFX**: *bzz... bzz...*
>
> **EVERYONE'S THOUGHT**: *No.*

## SCENE 4: THE CONFRONTATION (3 Panels)

### Panel 10 — Stan Steps Forward
**[Dynamic action]** Stan STEPS FORWARD, deliberately SNAPPING a rubber band. CRACK. The Audit Demon's head whips toward him. Stan is drawing its attention away from Heather. He stands between the demon and the crew, arms at his sides, jaw set.

> **STAN**: "The form's mine."
>
> **AUDIT DEMON**: *(static whisper)* "Irregularity... detected."

### Panel 11 — The Red Tape
**[Action panel]** The Audit Demon unfurls RED TAPE from its clipboard — literal red tape that moves like tentacles, wrapping around Stan's arms and legs. The tape has FINE PRINT written on it — regulations, subsections, form numbers. Stan is being pulled toward the clipboard. The demon's blank face has developed the faintest hairline CRACK of a smile.

> **RED TAPE TEXT**: "SUBSECTION 4.1.2... NONCOMPLIANCE... MANDATORY REVIEW..."
>
> **STAN**: *fighting* "I've been audited before."

### Panel 12 — Barb's Power Level
**[Full dynamic shot]** BARB steps forward. She pulls out her UNION CARD — it BLAZES with golden light. Her power level is visible for the first time: **LEVEL 42**. She slams the card on the table and recites the sacred words. The Audit Demon RECOILS. The red tape loosens.

> **BARB**: "BY THE POWER OF ARTICLE 19, SECTION 3 — MANAGEMENT SHALL NOT DISCIPLINE WITHOUT JUST CAUSE."
>
> **BARB**: "This carrier has REPRESENTATION."

## SCENE 5: AFTERMATH (2 Panels)

### Panel 13 — The Demon Retreats
**[Wide shot]** The Audit Demon dissolving back into the fax machine, its form being sucked in like smoke in reverse. The clipboard drops to the floor — the blue-ink form now has a stamp: "UNDER REVIEW — PENDING". Not resolved. Not dismissed. Just... PENDING. The office exhales.

> **SFX**: FWOOOOOSH
>
> **STAN**: "Pending?"
>
> **BARB**: "That's as good as it gets, kid."

### Panel 14 — Joy Level Drops
**[Final panel]** Wide shot of the office. Everything back to "normal" — but the MORALE THERMOMETER on the wall (a running office gag) drops from -5% to **-10%**. Chuck is being simultaneously demoted AND promoted — two different pieces of paperwork being filed at once. Heather stares at her phone — one new notification: "EMPLOYEE WELLNESS SURVEY." Stan sits at his desk, reaches for coffee. The mug is empty.

> **CHUCK**: "Am I a 204-B or a clerk? The form says both."
>
> **STAN**: "Welcome to federal employment."
>
> **[END - EPISODE 4]**
