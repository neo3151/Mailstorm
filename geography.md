# Geography of The Mailstorm

## 1. The Federal Building ("The Dungeon")
*   **Location**: Center of The Rust Belt.
*   **Architecture**: **Oppressive Brutalism**.
    *   A massive, windowless ziggurat made of "Bureaucratic Concrete" (a material that absorbs light and hope).
    *   **The Vibe**: It feels like a Soviet interrogation center crossed with a DMV that has been closed for 20 years.
    *   **The Smell**: A mixture of **Stale Ozone**, **Dust (from 1974)**, and **Burnt Rubber Belts**.

### Sub-Locations (The Circles of Hell)
*   **The Sorting Floor (The Grinder)**
    *   **Sensory Overload**: It is never silent. The **Dbcs Machines** hum at a constant 100 decibels, a sound known as "The Hive Mind".
    *   **The Dust**: "Postal Snow". It coats your lungs. Old-timers cough up zip codes from the 90s.
    *   **The Belts**: They scream. When they jam, it sounds like a dying robot.
*   **The Dock (The Mouth)**
    *   **Climate**: It is always the opposite of comfortable. In winter, the bay doors are stuck open (Arctic Draft). In summer, it is a heat trap.
    *   **The Hazard**: **"The Wiretainer"**. Rusted metal cages on wheels that hunger for shins.
*   **The Swing Room (The Purgatory)**
    *   **The Decor**: Vending machines that steal your money 40% of the time. Tables stained with coffee rings older than the new hires.
    *   **The Atmosphere**: No one speaks. They just stare at the wall, dissociating before their next loop.
    *   **The Myth**: There is a rumors of a "Clean Bathroom" on the 4th floor. It does not exist.

## 2. The Sprawl (Speedy-Go Territory)
*   **Location**: The floating neon city above the clouds.
*   **Architecture**: **Hyper-Capitalist Cyberpunk**.
    *   Glass shards piercing the sky, drenched in holographic ads for things you don't need.
    *   **The Vibe**: "High-Tech, Low-Life." Clean, sterile, but aggressively monetized. You have to pay a subscription fee just to breathe the filtered air.
*   **Key Locations**:
    *   **The Hive**: Speedy-Go's HQ. A drone swarm constantly orbits it like a halo of angry bees.
    *   **The Prime Lanes**: Designated highways for "Premium Citizens". Speed limit: Infinity.
    *   **The Gig Pits**: Where freelancers fight for scraps of delivery contracts.

## 3. The Rust Belt (The Old Routes)
*   **Location**: The ground level, beneath The Sprawl.
*   **Architecture**: **Analog Decay**.
    *   Crumbling brick factories, overgrown suburban cul-de-sacs, and rusted bridges.
    *   **The Vibe**: It smells like wet cardboard and nostalgia. This is where the D.O.L. still holds power.
*   **Key Locations**:
    *   **The Dead Zones**: Abandoned office parks where the Wi-Fi signal drops to zero. Haunted by "Dial-Up Spirits".
    *   **Route 666**: A legendary mail route that passes through a dimensional rift. Only a Level 50 Paladin (Carrier) can survive it.

## 4. The Liminal Spaces (The In-Between)
*   **Nature**: Areas where reality wears thin.
*   **The Backrooms**: Accessed by opening a door that shouldn't exist (or mis-scanning a package).
    *   **The Fluorescents**: They hum at a frequency that induces madness.
    *   **The Carpet**: Moist, beige, and infinite.
    *   **Inhabitants**: The "Lost Letters" (people who were mailed and never arrived).
