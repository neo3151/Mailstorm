## Scene 1: The Lobby (Liminal Brutalism)
**PANEL 1**
Wide shot of the **Federal Building**. It is a windowless ziggurat of grey concrete. It looks like it was designed by an architect who hated sunshine.
**Caption**: "The Department of Logistics. Where dreams go to get sorted."

**PANEL 2**
Interior, Lobby. **Stan** stands by the reception desk. The lighting is fluorescent yellow and flickering (The Backrooms hum).
**Stan (Internal)**: *7:58 AM. The hum of the lights is already draining my Willpower. I can feel my soul leaking out of my ears.*

**PANEL 3**
The front doors slide open. **Heather** walks in. She is wearing oversized headphones. She stops, confused.
**Heather**: "This isn't a post office. It looks like a prison for wizards."

**PANEL 4**
Stan approaches. He tries to smile, but it's a **Level 3 Grimace**.
**Stan**: "Close. It's 'Federal Architecture'. We call it The Dungeon."

## Scene 2: The Pit (The Safety Brief)
**PANEL 1**
They walk onto the main floor (The Pit). It is a chaotic sea of sorting cases. **Paper Golems** (piles of junk mail) seem to watch them from the shadows.
**Stan**: "Rule #1: The mail never stops. Rule #2: If you hear a giggling sound in the ceiling, stop smiling immediately. That's an Audit Demon."

**PANEL 2**
**Chuck** (The Supervisor) appears. He is wearing a tie that is too short and holding a clipboard like a shield.
**Chuck**: "ATTENTION! STAND UP FOR THE SAFETY BRIEF!"

**PANEL 3**
Chuck reads from a script that is clearly ancient parchment.
**Chuck**: "Todays Mantra: 'Pain is temporary. The Scan is forever.' Also, someone left a fork in the microwave and summoned a Fire Elemental. Stop doing that."

**PANEL 4**
Chuck points at Heather.
**Chuck**: "YOU! New Hire! Where is your Badge? That is a Class-2 Uniform Violation!"

**PANEL 5**
Heather holds up her phone, recording him.
**Heather**: "You said you were laminating it, then you ran into a wall."

**PANEL 6**
Chuck freezes. He activates his Special Move.
**Chuck**: **"Technique: PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY!"**
"I... was testing your memory! You passed! Stan, get her a badge before I write you BOTH up!"

## Scene 3: The Phantom Tray (Object Class: Keter)
**PANEL 1**
The Loading Dock. High stress zone. Stan stops. He senses a disturbance in the Corporate Ki.
**Stan**: "Wait. Do you smell that? It smells like... hubris."

**PANEL 2**
He points to a grey tray on a shelf. It is vibrating.
**Label on Tray**: *PRIORITY: URGENT*.
**Stan**: "A classic **Phantom Tray**. Someone marked it 'Done' without scanning it. Now it's cursed to refill forever."

**PANEL 3**
The tray begins to overflow with letters. They spill onto the floor like a waterfall.
**Heather**: "It's... multiplying?"
**Stan**: "It's feeding on our stress. Heather, film this. We need evidence for the Union."

**PANEL 4**
Use of **Magic**. Stan's eyes glow blue.
**Stan**: **"Form Change: EXPEDITER MODE."**

**PANEL 5**
Stan moves in a blur. He grabs the tray, scans the "Prime Barcode" (The Source), and tosses it onto the truck.
**Scanner**: *BEEP! ANOMALY CONTAINED.*

---

## Scene 4: The Aftermath
**PANEL 1**
The tray stops overflowing. The dock is silent. Stan returns to normal, panting.

**PANEL 2**
Chuck walks over, looking smug.
**Chuck**: "Good hustle, Stan. Exactly as I planned. I motivated you with my 'Managerial Presence'."

**PANEL 3**
Heather lowers her phone.
**Heather**: "I got him claiming credit on 4K. This is going straight to the Group Chat."

**PANEL 4**
Stan smirks.
**Stan**: "Welcome to the Department, kid. Here's your badge."

**PANEL 5**
**Final Shot**: The three of them stand against the grey concrete.
**Caption**: "The Shift has only just begun."
