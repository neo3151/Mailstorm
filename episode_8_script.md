**Theme**: The constitutional duty to deliver. The final run.

---

## SCENE 1: DAWN IN THE SPRAWL (3 Panels)

### Panel 1 — The Building at Dawn
**[Wide establishing shot]** The D.O.L. building — half-consumed by The Sprawl, floating between dimensions. Dawn breaks through the one remaining real window. Inside, the carriers are awake. They've been up all night. Stan stands at the loading dock doors — beyond them, instead of the parking lot, there's ROUTE 666: a nightmare delivery route that stretches through The Sprawl itself.

> **TEXT BOX**: "EPISODE 8: THE MANDATE"
>
> **STAN**: "There's only one way to get the building back."
>
> **HEATHER**: "The route?"
>
> **STAN**: "THE route."

### Panel 2 — The Challenge
**[Split panel]** Stan on one side, ACE on the other — separated by the dimensional barrier. Stan in his battered uniform, beaten-up satchel, the Golden Arrow Key. Ace in his sleek Speedy-Go suit, hovering, holographic HUD. The Final Delivery: one package, one route through The Sprawl. First to deliver wins. If Stan wins — the building returns to reality. If Ace wins — D.O.L. is absorbed.

> **ACE**: "One delivery. Route 666. Through MY terrain. You're insane."
>
> **STAN**: "I've been delivering for 25 years in a truck with no AC. Your 'terrain' is Tuesday."

### Panel 3 — The Package
**[Close-up]** THE PACKAGE. A simple brown box, no return address. The label reads: "TO: THE AMERICAN PEOPLE — FROM: THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE — HANDLE WITH CARE." The package glows faintly. It's THE MANDATE itself — the constitutional duty to deliver, made physical.

> **BARB**: "Stan. This is it. The Mandate. We deliver this, and the service survives."
>
> **STAN**: "Just another package."

## SCENE 2: ROUTE 666 (4 Panels)

### Panel 4 — The LLV Rides
**[Dynamic wide shot]** Stan's LLV — battered, rusted, duct-taped — BLASTING through the Sprawl. The landscape is a nightmare version of suburbia: houses made of chrome, lawns of circuit boards, mailboxes that are Speedy-Go drop stations. Stan drives with one hand, the Package secure beside him. The LLV shouldn't work here, but the Arrow Key in the ignition makes it REAL.

> **SFX**: VRRROOOOM (rattle rattle rattle)

### Panel 5 — Ace Pursues
**[Action shot]** Ace on his hover-platform, flanked by a V-formation of remaining Speedy-Go drones. He's FAST — blurring through the Sprawl like a neon bullet. He gains on Stan. Drones try to cut off the LLV, but Stan DRIFTS the mail truck around a corner with practiced precision — he's driven this truck for 25 years, he knows every inch.

> **ACE**: "You can't beat my speed in THAT."
>
> **STAN**: "I don't need speed. I need reliability."
>
> **LLV**: *(engine knock)* "knock knock knock"

### Panel 6 — The Obstacles
**[Montage-style multi-panel]** The Sprawl throws everything at Stan: roads that rearrange themselves, houses that shift positions, OPTIMIZATION WALLS that block his path. Stan navigates by INSTINCT — 25 years of routes carved into his muscle memory. He doesn't use GPS. He doesn't use maps. He KNOWS where to go. The Arrow Key on the dashboard glows brighter with each obstacle overcome.

> **STAN** (internal): *Left on Maple. Right on Oak. Skip the dead end on 5th. Same as always.*

### Panel 7 — Heather's Assist
**[Dynamic panel]** HEATHER appears — she's followed Stan into The Sprawl on foot, running through the geometric nightmare. She's carrying the GREEN TAG BAG, which is now ALIVE and helping — it SWALLOWS incoming drone attacks, eating the projectiles. She clears a path for Stan's LLV, Dog Spray in hand, blasting chrome obstacles.

> **HEATHER**: "YOU DIDN'T THINK I'D LET YOU SOLO THIS!"
>
> **STAN**: *(almost smiles)*

## SCENE 3: THE FINAL STRETCH (3 Panels)

### Panel 8 — Ace Falls
**[Action panel]** Ace pushes too hard. His hover-platform, designed for efficiency, can't handle the chaos of The Sprawl's shifting terrain. A road rearranges and he CRASHES — his tech failing in the universe his own company created. He tumbles, his holographic HUD shattering. He looks up at Stan's LLV passing him — disbelief.

> **ACE**: "But... the algorithm said..."
>
> **STAN** (passing): "The algorithm doesn't know about potholes."

### Panel 9 — The Destination
**[Wide dramatic shot]** The end of Route 666: a FRONT PORCH. Just a simple, normal front porch with a welcome mat. It exists in a bubble of reality within The Sprawl — a single human home that refused to be optimized. An OLD WOMAN stands on the porch, waiting. She's been waiting.

> **OLD WOMAN**: "I knew someone would come."
>
> **STAN**: "Ma'am. Package for you."

### Panel 10 — The Delivery
**[Quiet, powerful close-up]** Stan places the Package on the porch. The old woman touches it. The moment of contact, REALITY EXPLODES OUTWARD — a golden shockwave emanating from the porch, pushing back The Sprawl. Chrome peels away. Circuit-board grass becomes real grass. The sky returns. The shockwave races toward the D.O.L. building.

> **SFX**: (silence... then BOOOOOM)

## SCENE 4: THE RETURN (2 Panels)

### Panel 11 — The PMG Appears
**[Dramatic reveal]** In the aftermath, a FIGURE appears. THE PMG — the Postmaster General. But not the political appointee. The REAL one — the LICH KING of the postal service, a skeletal figure in an ancient uniform, colonial tri-corner hat, eyes of blue flame. He's existed since 1775. He surveys the restored building with approval.

> **PMG**: "The Mandate is fulfilled. The service continues."
>
> **STAN**: "What about Speedy-Go?"
>
> **PMG**: "Retreated. For now. They'll return — they always do. But today, the mail was delivered."

### Panel 12 — The Boon
**[Medium shot]** The PMG extends a skeletal hand. His single boon: "STABILITY." The word materializes in golden text, sinking into the building's foundation. No more attacks. No more reality shifts. At least for a year. The building is protected.

> **PMG**: "One year. Use it wisely."
>
> **PMG**: "And fix that fax machine. It disturbs me."

## SCENE 5: EPILOGUE (2 Panels)

### Panel 13 — A New Regular
**[Warm shot]** The office, back to normal. Morning light. Barb pins a new badge on Heather's uniform: REGULAR CARRIER. Not a CCA anymore. Heather stands taller — The Strut is fully cemented. Chuck claps awkwardly. The other carriers nod. Barb salutes.

> **BARB**: "You survived the gauntlet, kid. Welcome to the regulars."
>
> **HEATHER**: "Does it get easier?"
>
> **BARB**: "No. But you get stronger."

### Panel 14 — Stan Smiles
**[Final panel]** Stan at his sorting station. Normal day. Normal mail. He picks up a letter, puts it in the tray. Heather walks by with her own route. She nods. He nods back. And then — barely, just barely, for one single frame — Stan SMILES. Not a grin. Not a laugh. Just the faintest upward curve of a man who, against all odds, gives a damn.

> **TEXT BOX**: "THE D.O.L. SURVIVED ANOTHER YEAR."
>
> **TEXT BOX**: "THE MAIL WAS DELIVERED."
>
> **TEXT BOX**: "SEASON 1 — END"
>
> **[END - EPISODE 8 / SEASON FINALE]**
