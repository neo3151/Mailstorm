## SCENE 1: THE DRONES ARRIVE (3 Panels)

### Panel 1 — The Sky Darkens
**[Wide dramatic shot]** The parking lot of the D.O.L. building at dawn. The sky is filled with SPEEDY-GO DELIVERY DRONES — hundreds of them, sleek silver octocopters with glowing blue sensors. They fly in perfect formation, like a mechanical storm. Carriers stand in the parking lot, staring up. Coffee mugs frozen mid-sip.

> **HEATHER**: "Are those..."
>
> **STAN**: "Replacements."

### Panel 2 — Ace's Announcement
**[Medium shot]** ACE — Speedy-Go's top courier, floating on a hover-platform, skin-tight jumpsuit, holographic clipboard — descends in front of the building. He's projecting a HOLOGRAM showing efficiency metrics. The drones can do the work of 200 carriers. He smirks at Stan.

> **ACE**: "Progress, old man. These babies don't take breaks. Don't file grievances. Don't need HEALTH INSURANCE."
>
> **STAN**: "They also can't leave a package at the back door when Mrs. Hendricks has a bad hip."

### Panel 3 — Barb's Eyes Narrow
**[Close-up]** Barb watching from the loading dock. Her UNION CARD is already in her hand, glowing faintly. Her jaw is set. She's seen this before. Behind her, the other carriers are getting nervous — some looking at the drones, some looking at Barb.

> **BARB**: "Article 32. Subcontracting. They just crossed the line."

## SCENE 2: THE OATH (3 Panels)

### Panel 4 — The Break Room Gathering
**[Wide shot]** The break room — every carrier crammed in. Barb stands on a chair. The fluorescents give everything a war-room feel. She pulls out THE CONTRACT — a massive, leather-bound book covered in Union seals, thick as a dictionary. It HUMS when she opens it.

> **BARB**: "What they're doing isn't just layoffs. They're replacing FEDERAL CARRIERS with MACHINES. That's a violation of the National Agreement."
>
> **CHUCK**: "Can they... can they do that?"
>
> **BARB**: "Not on MY floor."

### Panel 5 — The Paladin Circles
**[Dynamic shot]** Barb leads the carriers in the PALADIN OATH — a union ritual. They stand in a circle, each touching the Contract with one hand. Golden light pulses outward. When they speak the words, the building SHAKES. The oath is old — older than the building, older than the service itself.

> **ALL**: "NEITHER SNOW NOR RAIN NOR HEAT NOR GLOOM OF NIGHT — NOR THE AUTOMATION OF CORPORATE GREED — SHALL STAY THESE CARRIERS FROM THEIR APPOINTED ROUNDS."

### Panel 6 — Time Freezes
**[Wide panoramic]** The moment the oath completes, TIME STOPS OUTSIDE THE BUILDING. Through the windows: drones frozen mid-air, cars stopped on the street, birds suspended. Inside, the carriers GLOW with golden union energy. The Localized Strike has begun. Nothing enters. Nothing leaves. The building exists outside of time.

> **HEATHER**: "Did we just..."
>
> **BARB**: "We struck. Now we hold the line."

## SCENE 3: THE SIEGE (3 Panels)

### Panel 7 — Drones vs. the Barrier
**[Action panel]** Speedy-Go drones, remotely reactivated by Ace, SWARM the building. They smash against the golden union barrier surrounding the Federal Building. Sparks fly. Some drones try to drill through. The barrier holds. Inside, Barb stands firm, sweat on her brow, maintaining the field with both hands pressed to the wall.

> **SFX**: CLANG CLANG CLANG
>
> **ACE** (over loudspeaker): "Drop the field, Barb. You can't hold this forever."
>
> **BARB**: "Watch me."

### Panel 8 — The Breach
**[Dramatic panel]** One drone finds a CRACK — the mail slot in the front door. It squeezes through, compact and deadly. Then another. Then FIVE. They reform inside the lobby, lasers scanning. They target the carriers. Stan steps in front of Heather.

> **DRONE**: "DELIVERY EFFICIENCY PROTOCOL — HUMAN CARRIERS: OBSOLETE — INITIATING REPLACEMENT."

### Panel 9 — The Microwave Gambit
**[Action comedy panel]** Chuck, actually being useful for once, grabs the break room MICROWAVE. He opens it, shoves a STAPLER inside, and hits start. The microwave emits a massive ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE — drones spark, twitch, and crash to the floor. Chuck stands there holding the smoking microwave, actually heroic for 3 seconds.

> **SFX**: BWMMMMMMM
>
> **CHUCK**: "EMP! I saw it in a movie!"
>
> **STAN**: "Chuck, that was actually—"
>
> **CHUCK**: "Don't. I need this moment."

## SCENE 4: THE STAND (2 Panels)

### Panel 10 — Barb Unleashed
**[Full dramatic spread]** The main drone swarm breaks through the barrier. BARB meets them head-on. She's GLOWING with union power — golden armor forming around her from solidified Contract pages. She holds the Contract like a shield and her UNION CARD like a blade. Her power level is FULLY visible: **LEVEL 42**. She charges.

> **BARB**: "THIRTY-TWO YEARS. SEVEN CONTRACTS. FOUR POSTMASTERS. I WILL NOT BE REPLACED BY A ROOMBA WITH WINGS."

### Panel 11 — Victory
**[Wide shot]** The aftermath. Broken drone parts everywhere. The union barrier is DOWN but the drones are DESTROYED. Barb on one knee, exhausted. Ace's hologram flickers on the lobby floor — he's furious, then cuts the connection. The carriers stand among the wreckage. The time freeze is lifting — outside, the world slowly starts moving again.

> **ACE** (hologram, flickering): "This isn't over."
>
> **BARB**: "It never is. That's what the contract is for."

## SCENE 5: STINGER (1 Panel)

### Panel 12 — Chuck's Moment
**[Final panel]** Chuck standing in the wreckage, still holding the smoking microwave. Everyone else has moved on. He's looking at the microwave with genuine affection.

> **CHUCK**: "I'm putting this on my performance review."
>
> **[END - EPISODE 6]**
