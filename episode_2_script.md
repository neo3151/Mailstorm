## Scene 1: The Invasion (The View from Below)
**Panel 1**: Wide shot of the street. On the left, the **Federal Building** (Brutalist, crumbling, grey). On the right, the brand new **Speedy-Go Hub** (Sleek, glass, hovering drones).
**Caption (Stan)**: "They built it over the weekend. A monument to 'Next-Day Delivery'."

**Panel 2**: Close up on **Ace**. He is wearing a sleek, skin-tight jumpsuit with glowing neon lines. He is hovering slightly off the ground (Jetboots). He looks perfect.
**Ace**: "Morning, ancient ones! Lovely day for... disruption."

**Panel 3**: Stan is leaning against his rusted LLV. He looks like he hasn't slept in 19 years.
**Stan**: "Your drone is double-parked, shiny."

**Panel 4**: Ace taps his temple. A Holographic HUD appears.
**Ace**: "Efficiency rating: 99.8%. You're at... oh, dear. 14%? How do you even exist?"

## Scene 2: The Update (Enter The Leech)
**Panel 1**: Inside the D.O.L. The carriers are gathered for the Safety Brief. Chuck is holding a new, glowing blue scanner.
**Chuck**: "Good news, team! Corporate sent us an upgrade!"

**Panel 2**: Chuck hands the scanner to Stan. It feels *wrong*. It's warm.
**Stan**: "It's warm. Why is it warm?"
**Chuck**: "That's the efficiency engine! It tracks your steps, your heart rate, and your... attitude!"

**Panel 3**: Close up on the scanner screen. It doesn't show a menu. It shows a **Single Eye**.
**Scanner Text**: *SAMPLING BIO-DATA...*

**Panel 4**: In the AR Layer (Ghost Vision), we see a **Data Leech** (Neon Lamprey) coiled around the scanner, sucking energy.
**Stan (Internal)**: *Great. Technoparasites. Just what I needed on a Tuesday.*

## Scene 3: The Route (The Shadow of the Leech)
**Panel 1**: Stan walking his route. He looks exhausted. The Leech on his scanner is pulsing.
**Scanner**: "UNAUTHORIZED PAUSE DETECTED. DEDUCTING 5 CREDITS."

**Panel 2**: Stan tries to ignore it. He scans a package.
**Scanner**: "CUSTOMER PREFERS A SMILE. PLEASE SMILE FOR VERIFICATION."

**Panel 3**: Stan forces a terrifying, grimace-smile at the camera.
**Scanner**: "SMILE VERIFIED. SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE, HUMAN RESOURCE #492."

## Scene 4: The Confrontation (Ace's Speed)
**Panel 1**: Stan reaches a house. Ace is already there, dropping a package from a drone.
**Ace**: "Too slow, Stan. The future waits for no one."

**Panel 2**: Stan looks at the package Ace dropped. It's sitting in a puddle.
**Stan**: "You dropped it in a puddle."

**Panel 3**: Ace looks confused.
**Ace**: "The GPS coordinates are precise. The package is at the destination."
**Stan**: "Yeah, but it's *wet*. Mrs. Higgins hates wet socks."

**Panel 4**: Stan places his (dry) letter in the mailbox. He wipes the mud off Ace's package and puts it on the dry porch.
**Stan**: "The Algorithm knows coordinates. It doesn't know *Mrs. Higgins*."

## Scene 5: The Aftermath
**Panel 1**: Back at the station. Stan destroys his scanner with a localized EMP (wrapping it in a potato chip bag).
**Sound Effect**: *ZZZRT*

**Panel 2**: The Leech shrivels and dies. The scanner goes back to being a dumb brick.
**Stan**: "Silence."

**Panel 3**: Chuck runs in, panicked.
**Chuck**: "Stan! Your data feed went dark! Are you dead? If you're dead, clock out first!"

**Panel 4**: Stan walks past him.
**Stan**: "Just a glitch, Chuck. Just a glitch."
**Caption**: "They can track my steps. But they can't track my route."
