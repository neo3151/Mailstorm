# The Official History of The Department (Classified 5-A)

## Era I: The Surveyor (1775)
*   **Real History**: Benjamin Franklin was the first Postmaster General.
*   **The Lore**: Franklin wasn't just a statesman; he was a **Geomancer**. He didn't just map routes; he laid **Ley Lines**.
    *   **The "Surveyors"**: The first Postal Inspectors. Their job wasn't to stop theft; it was to keep the roads "stable" against the warping effects of the untamed American frontier.

## Era II: The Railway Knights (1860-1910)
*   **Real History**: Railway clerks worked in the "death car" right behind the engine, armed with revolvers to fight off robbers.
*   **The Lore**: **The Iron Cavalry**.
    *   **The Job**: Sorting mail at 60mph while fighting off "Train Barnacles" (bandits and gremlins).
    *   **Casualties**: High. But the mail *never* stopped.
    *   **Owney the Dog**: The mascot who rode 140,000 miles. In lore, he was a **Grim-Scented Hound** who could smell a lost letter from three states away. He didn't die; he "transferred" to the Spirit Plane.

## Era III: The Pneumatic Delusion (1893-1953)
*   **Real History**: NYC had 27 miles of underground tubes shooting canisters at 35mph. They even mailed a live cat.
*   **The Lore**: **The Subterranean Accelerator**.
    *   The Department tried to create a physical "Internet" of tubes.
    *   **The Failure**: They drilled too deep. The tubes started delivering mail to *The Basement* (Hell).
    *   **The Cat Incident**: The cat came back... *wrong*.

## Era IV: The Parcel Post "orphanage" (1913-1915)
*   **Real History**: For two years, it was legal to mail children. May Pierstorff was mailed to her grandmother for 53 cents.
*   **The Lore**: **The Changeling Protocol**.
    *   Parents weren't just being cheap; they were sending their kids to "Safety" via the one organization that *cannot be stopped*.
    *   **The Ban**: Stopped not because of safety, but because the children started absorbing the "Mandate" and becoming too powerful.

## Era V: Operation Graphic Hand (1970)
*   **Real History**: The Great Postal Strike. Nixon sent 23,000 National Guard troops to NYC to sort mail. They failed miserably.
*   **The Lore**: **The Siege of New York**.
    *   Carriers stood still. The "Flow" stopped.
    *   The Army tried to move the mailbags, but found they were physically **unliftable**.
    *   **The Lesson**: You cannot move the mail with Muscle; you can only move it with **Authority**. The Department is not a job; it is a burden only the sworn can carry.

## Era VI: The Stagnation (Present Day)
*   **Status**: The Deep Magic is fading.
*   **The Threat**: Speedy-Go (The Private Sector) ignores the old Ley Lines. They use drones that fly *above* the protection of the Oath, making them vulnerable to "Sky Sharks" (Data Leaks).

## The Secret Chronicles (Classified Level 10)

### 1. The Dead Letter Office (The Mausoleum)
*   **Real History**: Started in 1825. Handled strange items like human skulls, live alligators, and a stolen Marc Chagall painting.
*   **The Lore**: **Purgatory**.
    *   When a letter has no destination, it gains sentience.
    *   **The Clerks**: Silent monks who patrol the archives, fighting off "Letter Golems" and "Abandoned Dreams".
    *   **The Danger**: If you read a Dead Letter, you become the recipient. You inherit the debt/curse/love confession.

### 2. The V-Mail Ritual (1942-1945)
*   **Real History**: To save weight in WWII, letters were microfilmed. 1,600 letters fit on one roll. 1 billion were sent.
*   **The Lore**: **The Great Compression**.
    *   The Department didn't just shrink the paper; they shrunk the *distance*.
    *   **The Spell**: "Victory Mail". It allowed a soldier in France to feel the touch of his wife in Ohio.
    *   **The Cost**: The compression technology was lost, but some claim Speedy-Go's "zip files" are a cheap knockoff.

### 3. The Inverted Jenny (The Glitch)
*   **Real History**: A 1918 printing error where the biplane was upside down. Only one sheet of 100 exists.
*   **The Lore**: **The Reality Anchor Failure**.
    *   The plane wasn't printed upside down; the *world* was upside down for 24 hours.
    *   **The Stamps**: They are fragments of that inverted timeline. If you lick one, you fall into the sky.

### 4. Project: Missile Mail (1959)
*   **Real History**: The USS Barbero fired a Regulus missile filled with 3,000 letters. It worked but was too expensive.
*   **The Lore**: **The ICBM (Inter-Continental Ballistic Mail)**.
    *   Postmaster Summerfield's attempt to weaponize delivery.
    *   **Why it ended**: It wasn't cost. It was because the missiles started *delivering themselves* to targets that hadn't ordered them.
