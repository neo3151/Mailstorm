# Boots on the Ground (The Reality of the Job)

The Department runs on three things: The Mandate, Caffeine, and **Spite**.
Here is the truth of the daily grind, witnessed by the Carriers of the 61st District.

## 1. The Chariot of Fire (The LLV)
*   **Real Lore**: The Long Life Vehicle (LLV) was built in 1987 with a 24-year lifespan. They catch fire so often (1 every 5 days) it's a statistical certainty.
*   **The Curse**: **"The Viking Funeral"**.
    *   Every Carrier knows their truck *wants* to die.
    *   **The Ritual**: When an LLV bursts into flames (usually loaded with Amazon packages), the specific smoke pattern predicts the next quarter's budget cuts.
    *   **The Rule**: "If it burns, it burns. Save the mail, leave the Amazon."
    *   **The Heat**: In summer, the cabin reaches 130°F. This is called **"The Kiln"**. It bakes the soul out of new hires, leaving only a husk that can deliver adverts without feeling pity.

## 2. The Eye of Sauron (The Scanner)
*   **Real Lore**: Management tracks every step via GPS. If you stop for more than 5 seconds, it flags as "Stationary Event". Management uses this data to harass carriers who are "stealing time".
*   **The Artifact**: **The MDD (Mobile Delivery Device)**.
    *   It is not a tool; it is a shackle.
    *   **The Voice**: It screams "SAMPLE REQUEST" at the worst possible moments (e.g., while fighting a demon dog).
    *   **The Harassment**: The "Stationary Event" alert is actually a psychic attack from Middle Management (Chuck) that lowers your Willpower.
    *   **The "Breadcrumbs"**: The digital trail you leave. If you deviate from the line, the **Algorithm** sends a Supervisor Demon to your location.

## 3. The Hounds (The Gatekeepers)
*   **Real Lore**: "Don't worry, he doesn't bite." (The lie every owner tells). Carriers use "Dog Spray" as a holy water equivalent.
*   **The Bestiary**:
    *   **The "Friendly" Labrador**: Distracts you with cuteness while you miss a deadline.
    *   **The Invisible Fencebeast**: A dog that exists only as a bark and a shock collar barrier.
    *   **The Spray**: It is the only weapon allowed. It doesn't hurt the beasts; it just *offends* them deeply. A sprayed dog loses 50 Reputation Points.

## 4. The CCA (The Sufferer)
*   **Real Lore**: City Carrier Assistants work 12-hour days, 7 days a week, with no benefits. They are the "grist for the mill".
*   **The Class**: **The Initiate**.
    *   **Trial by Fire**: A CCA is not considered "human" until they survive their first Christmas Rush (The Black Friday War).
    *   **Powers**: None. They have negative stats. They are often sent to "The Aux Route" (a route no living carrier has finished in a decade).
    *   **Survival Rate**: 10%.

# The Deep Magic (Tools & Rituals)

## Tools of the Trade

### 1. The Arrow Key (The Skeleton Key)
*   **Real Lore**: A universal key that opens every blue box, apartment panel, and gate in a specific zip code. Losing one is a federal crime punishable by firing (or worse).
*   **The Myth**: **"The City Key"**.
    *   It doesn't just open mailboxes; it opens *opportunities*. It can unlock a shortcut through time, a heavy heart, or the Executive Washroom.
    *   **The Chain**: It must be attached to your belt by a chain. If the chain breaks, the Key returns to the Void (and you get written up).

### 2. The Green Tag Bag (The Heavy Burden)
*   **Real Lore**: Specifically used for "relays" or heavy loops.
*   **The Enchantment**: **"Bag of Holding (Cursed)"**.
    *   It fits infinite mail, but it weighs exactly as much as your guilt.
    *   **"The Loop"**: A walking section that looks short on the map but physically stretches as you walk it (Non-Euclidean Zoning).

### 3. Rubber Bands (The Currency)
*   **Real Lore**: They are everywhere. On wrists, gear shifts, sidewalks.
*   **The Usage**:
    *   **Standard**: Holding letters.
    *   **Combat**: Snapped at annoying insects or coworkers.
    *   **Currency**: Can be traded with other carriers for favors (e.g., "I'll take your pivot for a handful of size 64s").

## Environmental Hazards

### 1. The Spider (Guardian of the Bill)
*   **Real Lore**: Mailboxes are often infested with spiders, wasps, or ants.
*   **The Monster**: **"The Arachno-Auditor"**.
    *   Lives in rural mailboxes.
    *   **Attack**: Jumps on your hand when you reach for the outgoing mail.
    *   **Defense**: "The Mail Flap Slap" (a technique taught in orientation).

### 2. "Animal Interference" (The Ultimate Excuse)
*   **Real Lore**: A scan option used to skip a house if there's a dog, bear, or swarm of bees.
*   **The Spell**: **"Sanctuary"**.
    *   When invoked, the house is sealed from the delivery. No force in the universe can compel you to approach.
    *   *Usage*: Also works on annoying customers ("That Karen is basically a badger. Animal Interference.").

## The Sacred Rituals

### 1. The Pivot (The Extra Work)
*   **Real Lore**: When a carrier calls in sick, their route is split up and given to everyone else. This extra chunk is a "pivot".
*   **The Curse**: **"The Mitosis"**.
    *   You finish your route, exhausted. Then looking at you from the floor is *another hour of work*.
    *   **The Phrase**: "It's just a little pivot." (It is never little).

### 2. The Safety Briefing (The Sermon)
*   **Real Lore**: Morning talks where management tells you to "drink water" and "dress in layers" while refusing to fix the AC.
*   **The Ritual**: **"The Hypocrisy"**.
    *   Carriers must nod and chant "Safety First" while knowing they will have to run red lights to make the truck.
    *   **The mantra**: "Be back in 8." (A magical impossibility).
