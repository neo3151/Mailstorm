## Scene 1: The Loading Dock — "Gearing Up" (4 panels)

> *5:45 AM. The loading dock. LLVs parked in a row like sleeping beasts. Stan and Heather stand before the oldest, rustiest truck in the fleet — Unit 2847.*

**Panel 1**: Wide shot of the loading dock. LLVs in a row, steam rising from hood vents. Unit 2847 is at the end — rusted, dented, duct-taped side mirror. Stan stands beside it like a knight before his war horse.
**Caption**: "Every route begins with one question: Will the truck start?"
**Stan**: *pats hood* "She's temperamental. Don't make eye contact with the dashboard."

**Panel 2**: Interior shot — Stan opens the LLV's back. Inside is a WALL of mail trays, parcels, and a mysterious green canvas bag. He begins the ritual: placing trays in sequence, rubber-banding letter bundles, loading parcels by size.
**Caption**: "The Loading Ritual. Every carrier learns it. No one teaches it."
**Stan**: "Letters left, flats right, parcels floor. Green Tag Bag goes BEHIND the seat. Never in front."
**Heather**: "Why not in front?"
**Stan**: "It bites."

**Panel 3**: Close-up EQUIPMENT SPREAD — Stan's belt and gear laid out like a warrior's loadout. Arrow Key on a chain, MDD Scanner holstered, Dog Spray in a hip pouch, rubber bands on wrist like prayer beads, pen behind ear.
**Stan** (V.O.): "Arrow Key. Scanner. Spray. Bands. That's all that stands between you and the route."
**Caption**: *"The Carrier's Kit — Standard Issue, Insufficient by Design."*

**Panel 4**: Stan tosses Heather a can of Dog Spray. She catches it, examines it like an alien artifact.
**Stan**: "Holy water. Don't waste it on anything under Level 3."
**Heather**: "What's Level 3?"
**Stan**: "Chihuahua with nothing to lose."

## Scene 2: The Widowmaker — "First Stop" (3 panels)

> *The LLV groans to life. They pull onto a suburban street. The route stretches ahead — endless houses, endless mailboxes. The sun is already hostile.*

**Panel 1**: The LLV lurching onto the route. Heather is passenger side (no AC, window jammed). The dashboard is a graveyard of warning lights. A small soot-covered gremlin is visible in the engine vent, grinning.
**Caption**: "Route 47-B. 'The Widowmaker.' 612 stops. 14 miles. One working brake."
**Stan**: "Gremlin's happy today. Good sign."
**Heather**: "There's a GREMLIN?!"
**Stan**: "Shh. He's sensitive."

**Panel 2**: Stan demonstrates the delivery flow. He slides open the door, grabs a letter bundle, flips through them like a card dealer, fans three into the box, slams it shut — all while the LLV is still rolling.
**Caption**: "The Motion. Perfected over 15 years. One hand on the wheel. One hand in the box."
**Stan**: "Don't stop. Don't think. Muscle memory."

**Panel 3**: Heather tries. She fumbles the letters, drops three on the ground, the wind catches a flat, the MDD Scanner screams "STATIONARY EVENT — 8 SECONDS."
**Heather**: "It's TRACKING me?!"
**Stan**: "Always. The Eye never blinks."
**Caption**: *"The Scanner registered 47 Stationary Events that day. Each one, a tiny death."*

## Scene 3: The Mailbox Mimic — "Teeth" (3 panels)

> *They approach a blue collection box at the end of a cul-de-sac. It looks normal. Stan stops the LLV.*

**Panel 1**: Stan and Heather approach a blue USPS collection box. It looks completely normal. Stan holds up his hand — stop.
**Stan**: "Breathe on it."
**Heather**: "What?"
**Stan**: "Breathe on the metal. If it fogs, it's alive."
**Caption**: "Mailbox Mimic. Identification Protocol: The Fog Test."

**Panel 2**: Heather breathes on the mailbox. The metal fogs. Then the slot opens wider — revealing ROWS OF TEETH inside the mail slot. The entire box SHUDDERS. Eyes appear where the "PULL" handle was.
**Heather**: "WHAT THE—"
**Stan**: *already pulling her back* "Steady."

**Panel 3**: Stan pulls out the Arrow Key. It GLOWS. He inserts it into the collection box's lock — the Mimic SCREAMS, flattens itself, and scurries away on tiny metal legs, its teeth chattering.
**Stan**: "Arrow Key. Opens anything. Even things that don't want to be opened."
**Caption**: *"The Arrow Key: Not just a key. A command."*

## Scene 4: Porch Pirates — "The Ambush" (3 panels)

> *A residential block. Stan leaves a package on a porch. As he walks back to the LLV, shadows move behind hedges.*

**Panel 1**: Stan sets a package on a porch. Mid-turn, he FREEZES. Three small, goblin-like figures are crouched behind a bush — Porch Pirates. They wear hoodies, have gleaming eyes, and are fixated on the package.
**Caption**: "Porch Pirates. *Goblinus Klepto.* Shadow Step. Turns invisible when a package touches the porch."
**Stan**: *without turning* "Heather. Rubber bands. Now."

**Panel 2**: Stan snaps rubber bands like a GUNSLINGER — pinging them off the goblins' foreheads. They screech and scatter. One tries to grab the package but Heather stomps on its hand with her boot.
**Heather**: "GET OFF!"
**Stan**: "Size 64s. The only currency that matters out here."
**Caption**: *"Rubber Band Art: The Snap, The Arc, The Judgment."*

**Panel 3**: The pirates retreat into the hedges, hissing. One shakes a tiny fist. Stan and Heather walk back to the LLV.
**Stan**: "You stomped it." *slight nod* "Good instinct."
**Heather**: *looks at her boot* "Was that... legal?"
**Stan**: "On the route? Everything is legal."

## Scene 5: The Karen — "The Boss Fight" (4 panels)

> *Last stop of the route. A McMansion at the end of a cul-de-sac. A figure stands on the porch, arms crossed, radiating psychic energy.*

**Panel 1**: Wide shot — the McMansion looms. On the porch stands THE KAREN. Hair swept, arms folded, radiating visible psychic energy waves. The grass around her feet is dying. Her aura reads "LEVEL 50."
**Caption**: "The Karen. *Customerus Entitlus.* Level 50 Boss Monster."
**Stan**: "Last stop. Don't speak. Don't engage. Don't make promises."
**Heather**: "I deal with Karens on TikTok every—"
**Stan**: "This is not TikTok, Heather."

**Panel 2**: The Karen attacks: "MY PACKAGE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HERE YESTERDAY. I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER." — The words manifest as a PSYCHIC SHOCKWAVE that cracks the sidewalk. Stan braces against it. His MDD Scanner cracks.
**Karen**: "I'LL CALL YOUR SUPERVISOR! I'LL CALL THE POSTMASTER! I'LL CALL MY CONGRESSMAN!"
**Caption**: *"The Scream. Psychic Damage. Stun 10 seconds. Will save or flee."*

**Panel 3**: Stan pulls out the MDD Scanner, holds it up like a shield, and hits "ANIMAL INTERFERENCE" — a golden barrier expands around him and Heather. The Karen's attacks bounce off.
**Stan**: "Animal Interference. Activated."
**Karen**: "WHAT DID YOU JUST CALL ME?!"
**Stan**: "Ma'am, the scan says what it says."
**Caption**: *"Animal Interference: The Spell of Sanctuary. No force can compel you to approach."*

**Panel 4**: Stan and Heather walk back to the LLV. Behind them, the Karen is frozen in place, mouth still open, mid-scream. The golden barrier fades. Heather's stride has changed — longer, more confident. She doesn't look back.
**Caption**: *"Heather unlocked: THE STRUT. Passive Buff. +5 Confidence. +10 Route Speed. -100 Fucks Given."*
**Stan**: *glances at her* "You walked out of there without flinching."
**Heather**: "Was I supposed to flinch?"
**Stan**: *almost smiles* "No. You weren't."

## Stinger: Back at The Dungeon (1 panel)

**Panel 1**: Back at the loading dock. Stan and Heather unloading. The Green Tag Bag squirms slightly as it's removed from the LLV. Chuck approaches with clipboard.
**Chuck**: "How was the Widowmaker?"
**Stan**: "Quiet."
**Heather**: *checking phone* "I got 14,000 steps. My Apple Watch thinks I ran a half marathon."
**Chuck**: "Did you use the new scanner protocols I—"
**Stan**: *walks past* "Goodnight, Chuck."
**Caption**: *"Route Complete. Carrier Survived. The Widowmaker claims no one today."*
