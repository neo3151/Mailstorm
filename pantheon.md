# The Pantheon (The Powers That Be)

## 1. The Founder: Benjamin Franklin (The Prime Geomancer)
*   **Real History**: First PMG, inventor, member of "The Hellfire Club" (rumored occultists).
*   **The Lore**: **The Ghost in the Machine**.
    *   **The Ley Lines**: He didn't just build a postal system; he laid a **Web of Authority** to bind the chaotic American continent.
    *   **The Artifact**: He forged the first **Arrow Key** from a lightning bolt caught with a kite. It is the only thing that can unlock "The Founder's Vault".
    *   **Current Status**: He is not dead. He exists as a **Spectral Advisor** in the Dead Letter Office. He only appears to those who have delivered 10,000 letters without a single error.
*   **The Ritual**: To summon him, you must burn a 1775 stamp and recite the Postal Clause backward.

## 2. The Executive: The Postmaster General (The Lich King)
*   **Real History**: Appointed by the Board. Recent PMGs have been controversial "businessmen" trying to dismantle the service.
*   **The Lore**: **The Cursed Vessel**.
    *   **The Curse of the Seat**: The PMG is not a person; it is a host body for **The Deficit**.
    *   **Physical Form**: He bleeds **Red Ink**. His skin is papery and dry, like old parchment.
    *   **The Paradox**: He wants to destroy the Department to save money, but the **Mandate** forces him to keep it running. He screams in his sleep about "Optimization".
    *   **The Cabinet**: His advisors are **Audit Demons** who whisper cuts into his ear.

## 3. The Board of Governors (The Council of Nine)
*   **Real History**: 9 members appointed by the President. They meet in secret and control the budget.
*   **The Lore**: **The Faceless Bureaucrats**.
    *   **Location**: They meet in **The Boardroom**, a space that exists outside of time (The 13th Floor of the Federal Building).
    *   **Appearance**: They wear identical grey suits. Their faces are blurs of static, like a smudged letter.
    *   **The Power**: They do not speak. They issue **"Memorandums"** that unmake reality.
        *   *Example*: "Memorandum 666: Gravity is increased by 10% on Mondays to encourage hustle."
    *   **The Quorum**: If all 9 meet, they can rewrite the Constitution. Luckily, they hate each other.

## 4. The Competition: The Shareholders (The Eldritch Investors)
*   **Real History**: Private equity firms that demand endless growth.
*   **The Lore**: **The Market Gods**.
    *   **Origin**: Entities from the **Market Dimension** (a plane of pure greed).
    *   **The Hunger**: They do not want money; they want **"Growth"**. If a quarter is profitable but not *more* profitable than the last, they devour a VP.
    *   **The Avatar**: **Ace (Speedy-Go)**. He is their champion. He has sold his soul for a jetpack.

## 5. The Union (The Paladin Order)
*   **Real History**: The NALC and APWU. They fight for contracts and safety.
*   **The Lore**: **The Shield of Labor**.
    *   **The Contract**: It is not paper; it is a **Holy Scripture**. It burns the hands of management.
    *   **The Stewards**: Warrior-Monks who can summon a **"Grievance Barrier"**.
    *   **The Strike**: The ultimate weapon. It stops time. It hasn't been used since 1970 because it nearly broke the universe.
