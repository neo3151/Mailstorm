# Episode 7: "Black Friday" — The War, Part 1

**Theme**: The busiest day. The longest night. The building falls.

---

## SCENE 1: THE MORNING RUSH (3 Panels)

### Panel 1 — The Wall of Packages
**[Wide overwhelming shot]** 4:00 AM. The sorting floor is BURIED. Packages stacked floor to ceiling. Every flat surface covered. Mail hampers overflowing. Carriers can barely move through the aisles. The sheer VOLUME of mail is drawn with oppressive detail — every box, every label. It's a mountain range of cardboard.

> **TEXT BOX**: "BLACK FRIDAY. THE DAY THE MAIL BECOMES A NATURAL DISASTER."
>
> **CHUCK**: "The volume is up 400% from—"
>
> **BARB**: "We KNOW, Chuck."

### Panel 2 — Stan's Thousand-Yard Stare
**[Close-up]** Stan staring at his route assignment. It's FOUR PAGES LONG. He's been through twenty Black Fridays. His face shows it — not fear, just the bone-deep exhaustion of a man who knows what's coming. He puts on his gloves with mechanical precision.

> **STAN**: "Heather. Today is going to be bad."
>
> **HEATHER**: "How bad?"
>
> **STAN**: "Bring two pairs of socks."

### Panel 3 — The Shareholders Watch
**[Dramatic shot]** ACROSS THE STREET, atop the Speedy-Go Hub, a DARK WINDOW. Behind the glass: SHAPES. The Shareholders — not human, not quite anything. Suggestion of tentacles, of too many eyes, of business suits that don't fit right over non-human anatomy. They watch the D.O.L. building with hunger.

> **SHAREHOLDER** (distorted): "Infinite growth... requires... acquisition..."
>
> **ACE** (kneeling before them): "The building will be yours by midnight."

## SCENE 2: THE SPRAWL EXPANDS (3 Panels)

### Panel 4 — The Ground Shakes
**[Wide exterior shot]** MID-DAY. The street between the D.O.L. and Speedy-Go HQ begins to CRACK. The asphalt splits. From below, something CHROME AND GEOMETRIC pushes upward — The Sprawl, Speedy-Go's alternate dimension of pure optimization, is bleeding into reality. The Speedy-Go building begins GROWING — adding floors, expanding sideways, consuming neighboring buildings.

> **SFX**: KRRRRRUNCH
>
> **HEATHER**: "Stan... the building across the street is... eating the Wendy's."

### Panel 5 — The Winch
**[Dramatic action shot]** From The Sprawl, massive CHROME CABLES launch toward the Federal Building — winches, hooks, tethers. They attach to the roof, the walls, the foundation. The Speedy-Go building is literally PULLING the D.O.L. building toward it, trying to absorb it into The Sprawl. The building GROANS.

> **SFX**: THOOM — CREAK — GROOOAN
>
> **BARB**: "THEY'RE PULLING US IN!"
>
> **STAN**: "Hostile takeover. Literally."

### Panel 6 — The Building Shifts
**[Interior chaos panel]** Inside the D.O.L., everything is TILTING. Desks sliding. Mail falling. The floor is at a 15-degree angle. Carriers bracing against walls. The lights are flickering between fluorescent yellow and Sprawl-blue. Reality is becoming unstable — the hallways are LONGER than they should be. Doors open to WRONG ROOMS.

> **CHUCK**: "The break room is now the bathroom!"
>
> **HEATHER**: "Which one?!"
>
> **CHUCK**: "BOTH!"

## SCENE 3: REALITY UNMOORED (3 Panels)

### Panel 7 — The Building Between Worlds
**[Wide dramatic exterior]** The Federal Building is now HALFWAY between reality and The Sprawl. One side looks normal — brick, American flag, USPS eagle. The other side is morphing — becoming chrome, geometric, Sprawl-ified. The building is being torn between two dimensions. The sky above it is split — normal clouds on one side, geometric Sprawl-patterns on the other.

> **TEXT BOX**: "THE D.O.L. FEDERAL BUILDING — UNMOORED FROM REALITY."

### Panel 8 — Stan Holds the Line
**[Interior shot]** Stan ANCHORS himself to the sorting floor by jabbing the Golden Arrow Key into the ground. The key creates a CIRCLE OF STABILITY around him — within the circle, reality holds. Gravity works. The mail stays put. Carriers huddle within the circle's protection.

> **STAN**: "Everyone inside the circle. The key holds reality."
>
> **HEATHER**: "For how long?"
>
> **STAN**: "Long enough."

### Panel 9 — The Shareholders Appear
**[Horror panel]** Through the walls that have become transparent, THE SHAREHOLDERS become visible. They're MASSIVE — filling the Sprawl that's pressing against the building. Eyes like stock tickers, mouths that speak in quarterly reports, bodies made of compressed financial instruments. They press against the reality barrier like faces against glass.

> **SHAREHOLDERS**: "GROWTH... MUST... BE... INFINITE... CONSUME... THE... COMPETITION..."
>
> **HEATHER**: "What ARE they?"
>
> **STAN**: "Capitalism."

## SCENE 4: THE RALLY (2 Panels)

### Panel 10 — Barb's Speech
**[Dramatic shot]** Barb stands before the huddled carriers inside the Arrow Key's protective circle. The building is groaning. Sprawl-light bleeds through the walls. But Barb is STEADY. She holds up the Contract — its pages glow in the dimensional chaos.

> **BARB**: "This building has stood since 1971. The SERVICE has stood since 1775. We do not bend. We do not break. We DELIVER."
>
> **BARB**: "Tomorrow, we fight back. Tonight, we HOLD."

### Panel 11 — To Be Continued
**[Final wide shot]** The carriers around the Arrow Key's golden circle — a tiny island of reality in a building being consumed by corporate darkness. Stan, Heather, Barb, Chuck. Mail piled around them like sandbags. The Shareholders pressing against the walls. Dawn visible through one remaining real window.

> **TEXT BOX**: "TO BE CONTINUED..."
