# Episode 9: \"The Ghost in the Machine\" — Season 2 Premiere

**Theme**: The Backlog never forgets. The Sorter never sleeps.

---

## SCENE 1: THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT (4 Panels)

### Panel 1 — The Backlog
**[Wide shot]** 8:00 PM. The floor is an ocean of mail. Trays of letters, mountains of packages, and the remnants of the day shift's "cleanup." The atmosphere is oppressive, dark, and heavy with the weight of the coming holiday. 

### Panel 2 — The Flat Sorter
**[Focus shot]** The Flat Sorter. Massive, metallic, and silent. It looks like a sleeping beast. The day shift finished it, but it feels like it's holding its breath. Dust motes dance in the fluorescent flicker.

### Panel 3 — The Scrubs Arrive
**[Low angle]** Three new night-shift carriers ("The Scrubs") walking onto the floor. They look young, cocky, and completely oblivious to the vibes. One is drinking a high-caffeine energy drink. Another is checking their watch.

### Panel 4 — The First Sound
**[Extreme close-up]** A single gear in the Flat Sorter clicks. Just one. In the silence of the building, it sounds like a gunshot. The Scrubs stop.

## SCENE 2: THE MACHINE AWAKENS (4 Panels)

### Panel 5 — Sudden Activation
The Flat Sorter ROARS to life without anyone touching the controls. The noise is deafening. Belts scream, diverters clack like teeth. But there is NO MAIL on the belts. It’s sorting thin air.

### Panel 6 — The Shadow Letters
**[Surreal shot]** Shimmering, translucent "shadow letters" begin to manifest on the belts. They aren't paper—they are made of dark smoke and static. The machine is sorting mail from The Sprawl.

### Panel 7 — The Diverter Trap
One of the Scrubs reaches toward the belt, confused. A diverter arm snaps out with predatory speed, snagging their sleeve. The machine is hungry.

### Panel 8 — The Machine-Man
Shadows from under the Flat Sorter coalesce. A figure made of tangled belts, sorting bins, and blue ink manifests. **The Sorter Wraith**. It has no eyes, only OCR sensors that glow a malevolent red.

## SCENE 3: THE PERMANENT COLLECTION (4 Panels)

### Panel 9 — The Collection Strike
The Wraith lunges. It doesn't use a claw; it hits with a "Return to Sender" stamp that leaves a glowing, burning mark on the floor. 

### Panel 10 — Stan's Warning (Remote)
**[Split panel]** Stan, at his home, clutching his coffee mug. He looks at his Arrow Key—it's vibrating and glowing. He knows. "The backlog is back."

### Panel 11 — The Beast Shadow
The mailbox shadow from the Season 1 finale appears on the wall of the sorting floor, massive and towering over the Scrubs. The machine wasn't the threat—it was just the gateway.

### Panel 12 — The Mandate's Flicker
The golden light of The Mandate is visible as a tiny, fading spark in a corner. The building is vulnerable again.

### Panel 13 (STINGER) — The Dead Letter Office
**[Close-up]** A single letter falls out of the Flat Sorter. It’s addressed to: **"THE SURVIVORS"**. Return address: **"THE PERMANENT COLLECTION."** 

**TO BE CONTINUED.**
